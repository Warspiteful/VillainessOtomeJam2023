    "The hit manhwa 'My Magical Kindness Made the Cold Prince Fall in Love!!' is the newest craze among manhwa readers."
    "Honestly…it's not the greatest out there. I've definitely read better. The plot is repetitive and the characters are the most basic tropes."
    "However…there's one thing that keeps me reading: the food."
    mc "Ahh! I just love how the desserts look so realistic!"
    mc "I know Otillia and Lewis are having a moment, but…"
    "I sigh, scrolling down my phone screen."
    mc "That strawberry shortcake… I want to reach through the screen and grab it."
    "My stomach growls and I sigh once again."
    "It's late at night, as it usually is when I do my daily reading of manhwa."
    mc "Maybe I should get a snack."
    mc "Just a few more chapters. Then I will."
    "As I read, I can feel myself getting drowsy."
    "The pale blue light makes my eyes tired. I try to keep myself awake, but my body feels weird."
    mc "Ugh…"
    "I lay back on my bed, phone in hand. My body feels light and tingly."
    mc "(Did I eat today? I'm sure I did.)"
    mc "(So why…do I feel this way?)"
    "My eyes drift close. I decide not to fight the feeling and fall asleep. I'll just eat a big breakfast tomorrow."

    "The next morning, I could hear the sounds of birds chirping. My nose twitches as a sweet scent slowly wafts through the room."
    "With a groan, I sit up, my eyes still closed. My muscles are sore and it feels as if I ran a marathon."
    "The smell of food is enough to make me crack open my eyes. Immediately, I notice a silver tray on my bedside."
    mc "What's this?"
    "I pick it up and set it on my lap. With a thick swallow, I take off the lid."
    mc "Oh. My. God."
    "On the tray is a delectable looking breakfast spread. Two scones, a tiny container of jam, a croissant, and even a bagel with cream cheese spread across it… My mouth is already watering."
    mc "Don't mind if I do!"
    "Without a second thought, I start digging in."

    "I let out a satisfied groan as I eat."
    mc "This is delicious!!"
    "Whoever made this deserves the world. It's absolutely perfect."
    "My thoughts are interrupted by a lady bursting into my room. I pause mid bite."

    "She stares at me."
    "I stare back."
    "She keeps staring."
    m "My lady?"
    "It’s not until that moment when my surroundings finally start coming into view."
    "An expensive wardrobe with a mirror gilded in gold. Expensive white trim detailing the entire room. Floral wallpaper. Thick and soft down comforter."
    "I am not in my bedroom."
    "I take another bite of my croissant, my eyebrows furrowing. The lady in front of me, who I now recognize as a maid, looks at me in concern."
    show davinia neutral
    mc "Hmmm…"
    "I keep looking around. An odd sense of familiarity settles in my stomach."
    "Something about this room…I know it."
    "I finish my croissant and then look over at the maid."
    mc "Can you hand me a mirror?"
    "She bows her head."
    m "Yes, my lady."
    "She seems nervous as she grabs a handheld mirror off the dressing table. She hands it to me, not making eye contact."
    "Clue number one."
    "I look in the mirror. I'm met with rosy and plump cheeks. My hair is short, brown, and curly."
    "Clue number two."
    mc "Ah. So it does happen."
    "Isekai: A genre where the main character gets transported to another world, usually through death."
    mc "(I don't remember dying. I only remember falling asleep.)"
    mc "Perhaps…"
    "I mutter to myself. I frown. There is a hint of disappointment. If I was going to be isekai'd…"
    mc "(I wanted to be hit by a truck.)"
    "Well, you can't pick and choose."
    "I set the mirror down next to me and pick up one of the scones. I slather a healthy amount of jelly on it and start to eat."
    "It would seem that I am now living in the world of 'My Magical Kindness Made the Cold Prince Fall in Love!!' Not my first choice."
    "I'm in the role of villainess. Also not ideal. In the many, many manhwa I've consumed, the villainess never gets the happy ending."
    "I pout, taking another bite of my food. I look over at the maid."
    mc "Where are we?"
    m "Excuse me?"
    "I speak again."
    mc "Where are we?"
    "The maid tries and fails to not look too concerned."
    m "The castle…"
    mc "Oh!"
    "My eyes widen as I pinpoint where in the story I was transported to."
    "My character, the villainess, is engaged to the love interest, Lewis. The heroine of the story, Otillia, has just started to study at the castle."
    "I sigh to myself, finishing my food."
    m "Are… Are you ready to be dressed, my lady?"
    "I nod and set the tray on the bed. I get up and get dressed with the maid's help."
    m "My lady…are you all right?"
    mc "Hmmm?"
    "I look over at her."
    mc "Oh, yes. I suppose breakfast has me feeling sluggish."
    m "The food wasn't to your liking again? I can inform–"
    mc "That's not it."
    "I wave her off, giving her a smile."
    mc "I guess I'm left wanting more."
    "I decide not to dwell on it. After I'm dressed, the maid leads me out into the common room."
    "She says nothing more, but it's obvious that she doesn't trust my word."

    "The common room is just as elaborate as my bedroom, if not more." #WIP: [mcname]
    "The first thing I notice is a large bookshelf sprawling the length of one wall. A heavy dark oak table is surrounded by velvet couches and chairs. Behind it are windows with thick red curtains that have been opened to let in the morning light."
    "A man sits in the padded chair at the head of the table. There's food laid out in front of him. All of it untouched."

    "Lewis, the love interest of the manhwa."
    "He was popular among readers due to his older age. And I have to say that he is much more handsome in real life."
    "A soft complexion, long hair with gray streaks, glasses that rest gently on his nose, and tied together with a stern expression…"
    "Megane: A character with glasses. Oftentimes, male megane are seen as stoic and aloof."

    "He clears his throat awkwardly."
    l "Do sit."
    mc "Right."
    "I sit across from him. My eyes keep flickering from him to the food in front of me."
    "There is even more delicious looking food than what I got this morning. I\’m practically drooling once again."
